TODO
====

* in is_prime_pocklington allow the cofactor to be a perfect power not just prime

* make n_gcd take arguments in either order and use throughout FLINT-Lite

* have make check bomb out if one of the tests aborts

* factor out some common code between n_is_perfect_power235 and n_factor_power235

* add profile code for factor_trial, factor_one_line, factor_SQUFOF

Maybe
=====

* make n_factor_t an array of length 1 so it can be passed by reference automatically, as per mpz_t's, etc

Enhancements
============

* Implement a primality test which only requires factoring of n-1 up to n^1/3 or n^1/4

* Implement a combined p-1 and p+1 primality test as per http://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove3_3.html

* Implement a quadratic sieve and use it in n_factor once things get too large for SQUFOF
