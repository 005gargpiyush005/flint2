int n_is_prime(mp_limb_t n)

   Tests if n is a prime. Up to 10^16 this simply calls n_is_probabprime
   which is a primality test up to that limit. Beyond that point it
   calls n_is_probable prime and returns 0 if n is composite, then it
   calls n_is_prime_pocklington which proves the primality of n in most
   cases. As a fallback, n_is_prime_pseudosquare is called, which will
   unconditionally prove the primality of n.
