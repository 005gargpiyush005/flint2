mp_limb_t n_powmod_precomp(mp_limb_t a, mp_limb_signed_t exp, mp_limb_t n, double npre)

   Returns (a ^ exp) % n given a precomputed inverse of n computed by 
   n_precompute_inverse(n). We require n < 2^53 and 0 <= a < n. There
   are no restrictions on exp, i.e. it can be negative.

   This is implemented as a standard binary powering algorithm using
   repeated squaring (and reducing mod n at each step).
