int n_is_strong_probabprime2_preinv(mp_limb_t n, mp_limb_t ninv, mp_limb_t a, mp_limb_t d)

   Tests if n is a strong probable prime to the base a. We require that
   d is set to the largest odd factor of n - 1 and npre is a precomputed
   inverse of n computed with n_preinvert_limb. We require a to be reduced 
   mod n and not 0 and n to be odd.

   If we write n - 1 = d*2^s where d is odd then n is a strong probable
   prime to the base a (an a-SPRP) if either a^d = 1 (mod n) or 
   (a^d)^(2^r) = -1 (mod n) for some r less than s.
