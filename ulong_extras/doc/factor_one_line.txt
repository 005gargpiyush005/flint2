mp_limb_t n_factor_one_line(mp_limb_t n, ulong iters)

   This implements Bill Hart's "One Line" factor algorithm.
   It is a variant of Fermat's algorithm which cycles through
   a large number of multipliers instead of incrementing the
   square root. It is faster than SQUFOF for < about 40 bits.
   
   The algorithm is described in full in Hart's paper, "A One 
   Line Factoring Algorithm". See:
