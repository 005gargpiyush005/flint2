n_mod2_precomp(mp_limb_t a, mp_limb_t n, double ninv)

   Returns a % n given a precomputed inverse of n computed by 
   n_precompute_inverse(n). There are no restrictions on a or 
   on n.

   As for mod_precomp for n < 2^53 and a < n^2 the computed 
   quotient is either what we are after or one too small. We 
   deal with these cases. Otherwise we can be sure that the 
   top 52 bits of the quotient are computed correctly. We take
   the remainder and adjust the quotient by multiplying the
   remainder by ninv to compute another approximate quotient as
   per mod_precomp. Now the remainder may have been either 
   negative or positive, so the quotient we compute may be one
   out in either direction.
