mp_limb_t n_divrem2_precomp(mp_limb_t * q, mp_limb_t a, mp_limb_t n, double npre)

   Returns a % n given a precomputed inverse of n computed by 
   n_precompute_inverse(n) and sets q to the quotient. There 
   are no restrictions on a or on n.

   This is as for mod2_precomp with some additional care taken
   to retain the quotient information. There are also special
   cases to deal with the case where a is already reduced mod
   n and where n is 64 bits and a is not reduced mod n.
