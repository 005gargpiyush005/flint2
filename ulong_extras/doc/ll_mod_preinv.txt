mp_limb_t n_ll_mod_preinv(mp_limb_t a_hi, mp_limb_t a_lo, 
                                     mp_limb_t n, mp_limb_t ninv)

   Returns a % n given a precomputed inverse of n computed by 
   n_preinvert_limb(n). There are no restrictions on a, which
   will be two limbs (a_hi, a_lo), or on n.

   This old version of this function merely reduced the top limb 
   a_hi mod n so that udiv_qrnnd_preinv could be used.

   The new version reduces the top limb mod n as per n_mod2_preinv
   then the algorithm of Granlund and Moller is used again to 
   reduce mod n.
