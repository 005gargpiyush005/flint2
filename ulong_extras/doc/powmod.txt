mp_limb_t n_powmod(mp_limb_t a, mp_limb_signed_t exp, mp_limb_t n)

   Returns (a ^ exp) % n. We require n < 2^FLINT_D_BITS and 0 <= a < n. 
   There are no restrictions on exp, i.e. it can be negative.

   This is implemented by precomputing an inverse and calling the 
   precomp version of this function.
