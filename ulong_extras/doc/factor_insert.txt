void n_factor_insert(n_factor_t * factors, mp_limb_t p, ulong exp)

   
   Inserts the given prime power factor p^exp into the n_factor_t
   factors. See the docs for n_factor_trial for a description of
   the n_factor_t type. 

   The algorithm performs a simple search to see if p already 
   exists as a prime factor in the structure. If so the exponent
   there is increased by the supplied exponent. Otherwise a new 
   factor p^exp is added to the end of the structure.

   There is no test code for this function other than its use by
   the various factoring functions, which have test code.
