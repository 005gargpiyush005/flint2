mp_limb_t n_lll_mod_preinv(mp_limb_t a_hi, mp_limb_t a_mi, 
                       mp_limb_t a_lo, mp_limb_t n, mp_limb_t ninv)

   Returns (a_hi, a_mi, a_lo) % n given a precomputed inverse 
   of n computed by n_preinvert_limb(n). It is assumed that
   a_hi is reduced mod n. There are no restrictions on on n.

   This function uses the algorithm of Granlund and Moller to
   first reduce the top two limbs mod n, then does the same
   on the bottom two limbs.
