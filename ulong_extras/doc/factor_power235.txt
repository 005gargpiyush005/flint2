mp_limb_t n_factor_power235(ulong *exp, mp_limb_t n)

   Returns 0 if n is not a perfect square, cube or fifth power.
   Otherwise it returns the root and sets exp to either 2, 3 or
   5 appropriately. 
  
   This function uses a series of modular tests to reject most
   non 235-powers. Each modular test returns a value from 0 - 7
   whose bits respectively indicate whether the value is a square,
   cube or fifth power modulo the given modulus. When these are
   logically ANDed together, this gives a powerful test which will
   reject most non-235 powers. 

   If a bit remains set indicating it may be a square, a standard
   square root test is performed. Similarly a cube root or fifth 
   root can be taken, if indicated, to determine whether the power
   of that root is exactly equal to n.

   The root is then returned, along with the exponent found.
