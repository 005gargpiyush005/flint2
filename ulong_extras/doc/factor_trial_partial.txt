mp_limb_t n_factor_trial_partial(n_factor_t * factors, mp_limb_t n, 
                  mp_limb_t * prod, ulong num_primes, mp_limb_t limit)

   Trial factor n with the first num_primes primes, but
   stop when the product of prime factors so far exceeds limit. 
   
   One requires an initialised n_factor_t structure, but factors
   will be added by default to an already used n_factor_t. Use 
   the function n_factor_init defined in ulong_extras if 
   initialisation has not already been completed on factors.
   
   Once completed, num will contain the number of distinct 
   prime factors found. The field p is an array of mp_limb_t's 
   containing the distinct prime factors, exp an array 
   containing the corresponding exponents.

   The return value is the unfactored cofactor after trial 
   factoring is done. The value prod will be set to the product
   of the factors found.

   The function calls compute_primes automatically. See
   the docs for that function regarding limits.

   The algorithm stops when the current prime has a square 
   exceeding n, as no prime factor of n can exceed this 
   unless n is prime.

   The precomputed inverses of all the primes computed by
   n_compute_primes are utilised with the n_remove2_precomp
   function.
