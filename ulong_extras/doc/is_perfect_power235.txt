int n_is_perfect_power235(mp_limb_t n)

   Returns 1 if n is a perfect square, cube or fifth power. 
  
   This function uses a series of modular tests to reject most
   non 235-powers. Each modular test returns a value from 0 - 7
   whose bits respectively indicate whether the value is a square,
   cube or fifth power modulo the given modulus. When these are
   logically ANDed together, this gives a powerful test which will
   reject most non-235 powers. 

   If a bit remains set indicating it may be a square, a standard
   square root test is performed. Similarly a cube root or fifth 
   root can be taken, if indicated, to determine whether the power
   of that root is exactly equal to n.
