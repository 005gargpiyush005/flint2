int n_is_probabprime_fibonacci(mp_limb_t n)

   Letting F_j be the j-th element of the Fibonacci sequence 
   0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ... starting at j = 0. Then if n is prime
   we have F_{n - (n/5)} = 0 mod n, where (n/5) is the Jacobi
   symbol.
 
   See page 142 and following of Pomerance and Crandall : Primes
   a computational perspective for details.

   We require that n is not divisible by 2 or 5.
