mp_limb_t n_factor_partial(n_factor_t * factors, 
                     mp_limb_t n, mp_limb_t limit, int proved)


   Factor n, but stop when the product of prime factors so far 
   exceeds limit. 
   
   One requires an initialised n_factor_t structure, but factors
   will be added by default to an already used n_factor_t. Use 
   the function n_factor_init defined in ulong_extras if 
   initialisation has not already been completed on factors.
   
   Once completed, num will contain the number of distinct 
   prime factors found. The field p is an array of mp_limb_t's 
   containing the distinct prime factors, exp an array 
   containing the corresponding exponents.

   The return value is the unfactored cofactor after 
   factoring is done. 

   The factors are proved prime if proved is 1, otherwise
   they are merely probably prime.
