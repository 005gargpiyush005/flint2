mp_limb_t n_sqrtrem(mp_limb_t * r, mp_limb_t a)

   
   Computes the integer truncation of the square root of a. The integer
   itself can be represented exactly and its square root is computed
   to the nearest place. If a is one below a square, the rounding may be
   up, whereas if it is one above a square, the rounding will be down.
   Thus the square root may be one too large in some instance. We also 
   have to be careful when the square of this too large value causes an
   overflow. The same assumptions hold for a single precision float so
   long as the square root itself can be represented in a single float, 
   i.e. for a < 281474976710656 = 2^46. The remainder is computed by 
   subtracting the square of the computed square root from a.
