          mp_size_t total_limbs, mp_size_t coeff_limbs, mp_size_t output_limbs)

    Split an integer \code{(limbs, total_limbs)} into coefficients of length
    \code{coeff_limbs} limbs and store as the coefficients of \code{poly}
    which are assumed to have space for \code{output_limbs + 1} limbs per
    coefficient. The coefficients of the polynomial do not need to be zeroed
    before calling this function, however the number of coefficients written
    is returned by the function and any coefficients beyond this point are
    not touched.

mp_size_t fft_split_bits(mp_limb_t ** poly, mp_limb_t * limbs, 
               mp_size_t total_limbs, mp_bitcnt_t bits, mp_size_t output_limbs)

    Split an integer \code{(limbs, total_limbs)} into coefficients of the given
    number of \code{bits} and store as the coefficients of \code{poly} which are
    assumed to have space for \code{output_limbs + 1} limbs per coefficient. The
    coefficients of the polynomial do not need to be zeroed before calling this
    function, however the number of coefficients written is returned by the
    function and any coefficients beyond this point are not touched. 

void fft_combine_limbs(mp_limb_t * res, mp_limb_t ** poly, long length, 
            mp_size_t coeff_limbs, mp_size_t output_limbs, mp_size_t total_limbs)

    Evaluate the polynomial \code{poly} of the given \code{length} at 
    $B^\mbox{coeff\_limbs}$, where $B = 2^\mbox{FLINT_BITS}$, and add the result 
    to the integer \code{(res, total_limbs)} throwing away any bits that exceed 
    the given number of limbs. The polynomial coefficients are assumed to have at 
    least \code{output_limbs} limbs each, however any additional limbs are ignored. 
    If the integer is initially zero the result will just be the evaluation of the 
    polynomial.

void fft_combine_bits(mp_limb_t * res, mp_limb_t ** poly, long length, 
                 mp_bitcnt_t bits, mp_size_t output_limbs, mp_size_t total_limbs)

    Evaluate the polynomial \code{poly} of the given \code{length} at 
    $2^\mbox{bits}$ and add the result to the integer \code{(res, total_limbs)}
    throwing away any bits that exceed the given number of limbs. The polynomial
    coefficients are assumed to have at least \code{output_limbs} limbs each,
    however any additional limbs are ignored. If the integer is initially zero
    the result will just be the evaluation of the polynomial.
