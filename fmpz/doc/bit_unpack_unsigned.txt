void fmpz_bit_unpack_unsigned(fmpz_t coeff, 
              const mp_limb_t * arr, mp_bitcnt_t shift, mp_bitcnt_t bits)
 
   A bit field of the given number of bits is extracted from arr,
   starting after shift bits, and placed into coeff. 

   The value of shift is expected to be less than FLINT_BITS.
