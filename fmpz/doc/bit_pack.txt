int fmpz_poly_bit_pack(mp_limb_t * arr, mp_bitcnt_t shift, 
		mp_bitcnt_t bits, fmpz_t coeff, int negate, int borrow)

   Shift left the given coefficient by _shift_ bits and add it to the 
   integer in arr in a field of the given number of bits.

   shift  bits  --------------

   X X X C C C C 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 

   An optional borrow (of 1) can be subtracted from the coeff before 
   it is packed. If the coeff is negative (after borrow), then a 
   borrow will be returned by the function. 

   The value of shift is assumed to be less than FLINT_BITS. All but 
   the first shift bits of arr are assumed to be zero on entry to the
   function.

   The value of coeff may also be optionally (and notionally) negated 
   before it is used, by setting the negate parameter to -1.
