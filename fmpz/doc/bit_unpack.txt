int fmpz_bit_unpack(fmpz_t coeff, mp_limb_t * arr, 
	mp_bitcnt_t shift, mp_bitcnt_t bits, int negate, int borrow)
 
   A bit field of the given number of bits is extracted from arr,
   starting after shift bits, and placed into coeff. An optional
   borrow (of 1) may be added to the coefficient. If the result is
   negative, a borrow of 1 is returned. Finally, the resulting 
   coeff may be negated by setting the negate parameter to -1.

   The value of shift is expected to be less than FLINT_BITS.
