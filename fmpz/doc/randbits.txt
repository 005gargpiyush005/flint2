void fmpz_randbits(fmpz_t f, mp_bitcnt_t bits)

   Generates a random signed integer whose absolute value has the given
   number of bits.

   If one requests random numbers with more than FLINT_BITS - 2 bits
   one must first call fmpz_randinit(). When one is finished generating
   random numbers one should call fmpz_randclear() to clean up.
 
   Because this function depends on a global random state it isn't 
   threadsafe.
