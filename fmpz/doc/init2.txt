void fmpz_init2(fmpz_t f, ulong limbs)

   Initialises the given fmpz_t to have space for the given number
   of limbs. It is not necessary to call this function except to 
   save time. A call to fmpz_init(f) will do just fine.

   If limbs is zero then a small fmpz_t is allocated, i.e. just
   a long. The value is also set to zero.
