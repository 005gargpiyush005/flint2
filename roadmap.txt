FLINT 2 Roadmap
===============

This documents sets out a list of functions which have been implemented in flint2 which are
not intended to be optimal implementations, and thus can be significantly improved in future
and also lists functions which have not been added, which would improve performance and
functionality were they added. 

Thus this document serves as a roadmap. Functions listed here are candidates for contributors
to consider working on to improve flint2.

fmpz_poly
---------

fmpz_poly_mul (mul.c) 
   currently only uses classical, karatsuba and KS multiplication. When Schoenhage-Strassen
   algorithm (SSA) is added, it should be used. Also need cutoffs to be tuned per architecture.
   Note SSA relies on a very sophisticated FFT such as the one developed for MPIR, (but not
   used by MPIR yet), written by Bill Hart.
